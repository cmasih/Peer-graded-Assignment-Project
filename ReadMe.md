
# **Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to prepare a tidy dataset by using the UCI HAR Dataset (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset).

The data for this project was downloaded from the following link:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The contents of the zip folder were extracted and read into R. 

## Analysis

The test and train measurements were tidied using tidyr and dplyr packages in R. 

The steps for obtaining the tidy data have been mentioned in the *CodeBook.md* file in this repository and the script named *run_analysis.R* contains the code written to obtain the tidy data set. 

The end file is named is named *tidydata.txt* which can be accessed in this repository.
